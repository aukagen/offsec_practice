Create a script which brute forces the key?
- migth be a bit too long


functions to check:
_decrypt_full_version_
_key_full_template_trial_
--> length  ??

key = 8 chars?

REVERSE CHECK KEY!


user key inputted --> then checked --> if right, full version will be unlocked

full key = _picoCTF{1n_7h3_|<3y_of_xxxxxxxx}_ where the 8x is the number that needs finding


key = ac73dc2?
picoCTF{1n_7h3_|<3y_of_ac73dc29}
