When I realised the \ character was filtered out, I proceeded to try all the special characters at the top of my keyboard. The # would make anything after it obsolete, and when I tried th & sign, the command I ran after was executed

Now the next question was how to use make spaces work..

SOLVED: URL encoded version of space: %20

hmmm, it worked for ls -al, but not catting the flag...
I could cat the dockerfile so think it has to do with the .txt extension...

I could also cat package.json so dont think its that ^...

AHHHHHHHH the file was not called flag.txt but falg.txt :')

I think it is called prototype pollution
...Yes it is, and it is possible because of the _exec()_ function. By using the _&_ it basically runs `/usr/games/cowsay & <whatever command we tell it to>`. There is lack of sanitation and is apparently a new but more and more common vulnerability in js

Instead of the _&_ being used, it is also possible to use _;_
